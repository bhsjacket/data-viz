# Data Visualizations
Datasets and visualizations for the Berkeley High Jacket.
## [COVID-19 Visualizations](https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/2020/multimedia/live-coronavirus-data/)
This is the file structure needed to get started:
```
covid-19.php
cache
├── alameda
├── berkeley
├── berkeley_testing
├── counties
└── new_cases
```
JSON files will be saved in each directory. They're very small (~2KB), and only ten will be created each day.

**Do not remove our logo or use the** `hide_logo` **URL parameter when embedding.**
